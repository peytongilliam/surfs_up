# surfs_up
## Overview
We are analyzing weather data in Hawaii to determine the weather patterns for June and December. We are wanting to make sure the surf shop will be successful and continue to maintain itself year-round. We are looking at June and December specifically due to the differences in the weather from summer in June to winter in December. We ran these queries and got these temperatures in a list that we put into a dataframe. This dataframe allows us to see the results from each month in a table. 

## Results
Below is the result for our June query.

June's total count is 1700 while December's is 1517 which is a difference of 183.
The mean in June is 74.9 while the mean in December is 71.0 which is a difference of 3.9.
The standard deviation for June is 3.26 and the standard deviation is 3.75. There is a difference of 0.49 between June and December.

## Summary
The results of our queries help us determine the temperatures for the seasons in Hawaii to see how successful the surf shop will be. We still need to perform a couple more queries in order to see how the weather will be in terms of precipitation and other aspects, but this is a wonderful start to our analysis.
